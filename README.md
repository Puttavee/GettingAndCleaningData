#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project Assignment

##Overview
The project is to collect, work with, and clean a data set which is prepared tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
This project will provide
  1) a tidy data set (do not shown - it will be in submission)
  2) a R script (https://github.com/Puttavee/GettingAndCleaningData/blob/master/run_analysis.R)
  3) a codebook that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up 
  the data called CodeBook.md. (https://github.com/Puttavee/GettingAndCleaningData/blob/master/Codebook.md)

The data source is from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

##Project Summary
One R script called run_analysis.R  is created with following process:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable
for each activity and each subject.
